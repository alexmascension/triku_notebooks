# triku notebooks
In this repo we are going to upload the notebooks related to the `triku` package (https://gitlab.com/alexmascension/triku). The notebook will contain information about the package and the underlying rationale, as well as the code necessary to reproduce the figures in the manuscript. 

**If the figures after production do not look exactly like in the paper, that is because cosmetic changes were done. None of the figures have been subjected to data manipulation.**
